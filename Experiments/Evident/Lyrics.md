Instrumental Name: Company Flow - 8 Steps To Perfection Instrumental
     
Score high in measurements  
Religion past tense  
Win cos they pack light, my punches is dense  
True in every sense cept that my mind is fenced  
With skulls I still fence  
I get stabbed in romance  
Evidence makes judges drop charges  
It ain’t evident if farces make me spit sentiments  
Maybe it’s that all my words making sense  
Or maybe my ego belittle they measurements  
Your religion’s out-dated like past tense  
I’m the type to pick fights with revrends  
And win cos they pack light while I'm packing dense  
True in every sense cept my mind which by skull is fenced  
Thank God for that barrier or we’d all be mince  
Not the Christmas type or the Christian type, I intended offence  
Spectators questioning if it’s them I meant in my sentences  
Or if I’m talking shit and they’re witnesses  
In parenthesis, knowledge I'll out last while taking the piss
