Instrumental Name: Jay Electronica - So What You Saying Instrumental
  
Iterations of complications  
Foundations of neo nations  
Frustrations up in flames like Hatians  
Always on vacations, work angles in so many combinations  
Accusation strangles calculations  
Have no decorations  
'Spite high expectations  
Never-ending fluctuations  
That span generations  
Generate new innovations  
None of these are revelations  
Won't see me in the publications  
Always in some situations  
Representing populations  
Full of observations  
Many occupations  
but I don't mean operations  
Have some obligations  
To keep it legal, to keep taking     medications  
Infinite - can't test my patience  
Laying down a new renaissance  
After being a vagrant
