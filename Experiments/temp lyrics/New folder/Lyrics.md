Crush writers blocks like I work demolition  
I've got inspiration beyond that of religion  
Touch something tough photons bounce of off my skin  
Off mic off me comes off all of my sin
Strikes like Tyson  
Recoil from action, do I have traction?  
Kill like Ricin  
Food's only thing I'm biting
More than one meaning yet only one writing  
Double visions, double definitions
Trouble in my missions  
Saddle beats - yeah boi I'm riding
End up streets ahead of the lightening  
Beyond storms hoofs trampling
Beyond doors perception is frightening  
Donâ€™t spar out fear I'll wreck ya in full contact fighting  
Dealing with me is like neat ether huffing  
Opps just chill like being around me either gets them high like cocaine, reefer or something    
Call me seer, call me to tell me you want me slither my way to a river and drown all the rats who grief ya  
I might just find somewhere without rats and place you there to deliver, take payment and thief ya
