Crushing writer's blocks, demolition-style,
My inspiration transcends religious aisles.
When photons bounce off my skin, I touch the tough,
Off the mic, my sins strike domes like Tyson's uppercut.

Did I ever have traction? Recoiling from the action,
I kill wackness like Ricin, no satisfaction.
Food's the only thing I'm biting, layers of meaning,
Yet only one writing—my visions, my dreaming.

Double entendres, definitions in collision,
Trouble in my missions, but I ride with precision.
Streets ahead of lightning, beyond storm's trampling,
Perception through doors, frightening and dismantling.

Don't spar out of fear; I'll wreck you in full-contact,
Dealing with me's like huffing ether, an abstract pact.
Opponents chill—cocaine or reefer high,
Call me a seer; I'll slither to the river, rats will die.

Somewhere rat-free, I'll place you to deliver,
My verses sharp, cutting through like a quiver.
