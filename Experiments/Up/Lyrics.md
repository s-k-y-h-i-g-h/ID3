This track is tried and true  
Bliss where I exist, scribing words by others dismissed cept few  
Fist up in air, white as clouds up in the air  
Double tap rhymes cos I don't give a care  
Double wrap, double rap  
Opp of crack, get you hooked on this black  
Composure right as I am surging like power out plant on apex converging  
Soul clean like a detergent with hands like that of a sergeant  
I'm verging on the sublime with every dime dropped by my mind out my mouth and on time  
Not even hint of lime in my light yet in spot I stay cos it’s bright  
Disciples of what I spit on the mic know every bar’s virgin tight  
Fair if you take these words and take a bite for I intend to spread like them parasites
