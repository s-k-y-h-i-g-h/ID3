Instrumental Name: Vast Aire - Adversity Strikes (Instrumental)

Without trace of sadness  
Irradiate whole world with the badness  
This ain't madness, it's dopeness  
That hits stronger than heron in veins  
Order rearranged by my hands through the reins  
Chaos never strange to me but foreign remains  
Cross at the ford of the flow  
Toss rhyme scheme cross the board like I know  
I'm boss of time in a trireme, hands row  
Feet in columns, two tall  
Never too short, stall  
Engines failed, trajectory curl  
Eject towards pearls  
Land I stand on as if I was an earl  
Noble I'm called by them all  
Smoke but not L  
Take not a single one L  
It's W three, stand with me or get felled like a tree  
All things I touch elevated  
To the top I will escalate it  
Till I hit top of the state  
Where my name will be stated
