Tell like it is  
Sell bits of mic to fund my biz  
Lose voice the in process  
Utilising forces  
On opps casting curses  
First to thirst for the sources  
Also reverse this  
Worst is landing in hearses  
Terse is the end unless I learn enough courses  
To side-step with life the divorces  
Is this my fate or will I lose in this versus?  
Unless I play chess with a date  
Then them undress hour late  
Depending on their out of ten rate  
Might mate, won't replicate  
To save someone their fate  
And for someone else the work to cremate
