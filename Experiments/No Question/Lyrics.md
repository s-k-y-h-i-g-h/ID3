Instrumental Name: The Foreign Exchange - The Answer (Instrumental)
  
Crush writer's blocks, call me Mario  
I will parry, divide but won't carry y'all  
Make my own beats, spit my own flows, am my own impressario  
Fill my own seats, grit my own teeth, this is the scenario  
Only day is today, hate tomorrow  
Pass me paper, borrow  
Me a way to make feet move, shuffle  
So I can get some space from these snuffles    
Extend range on the daily  
Impending uptrend - if I was a tree I'd tower over a sea  
Offhand, see CD to see me
Intend this - a decree - power in thirty three  
Every spend is over in poverty  
Transcend norms and imagination my G  
Comprehend what I mean and read the leaves in the tea
