I'm over dressed
And this I stress
I'm over stress but over stressed 
Talk like I'm blessed

I'm ain't street but I'll break it down - I've lived on it
Smoked, rapid hearbeat, crack, and it's gone, innit
Admit I used cook it with heat, bag of calm but knowingly quit 
Cos taste can be bitter when something looks sweet
Drank so much you could swim in, that's how I stayed fit
Pacing back and forth on concrete, on repeat
Fly to neon glow of a shop like a fly
Buy a cider, say hi, already drinking instead of a bye
Cough, puke, therefore one more I must try
Alcoholic from my feet to the sky
Life was too loud, that must be why


So deep you could drown, innit?
I don't rap to compete
I'm just trying to be one of the elite
I don't get hung up on that sheeeeit
Rise when the sun's in retreat
Nocturnal
