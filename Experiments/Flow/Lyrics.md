Instrumental Name: MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn - Let Me Watch/ Can I Watch? (Instrumental)

Grow hot, throw self out cold spot I'm in, retaliating   
Sin stained so never back in heaven I'm in  
I mean to bring it down, the whole of heaven, I mean
Lean but I ain't taking codeine  
Defined by weight I'm pushing  
A trap, I'm vermin slicing  
Dose odds with even measures ricin  
Opps suck like Dyson
Mind state of ronin, either asleep or roaming  
Honing in on building a Rome on land that I'm purchasing   
With blood, silver, gold and the green  
Deep in the mud nothing's green
I'm brighter than bling  
Stronger like a diamond is to a tin  
Stop on point- terminating but I run red, donâ€™t stop  
Except shops operating    
Ain't ever left I simply wasn't writing  
This takeover polarising  
I'm making scenes and causing steel to melt with my steam  
Big cat, pen of mice, mics that I'm rapping in  
It's never a wrap, I only talk when I rap and only rap when I sing    

Without trace of sadness  
Irradiate whole world with the badness  
This ain't madness, it's dopeness  
That hits stronger than heron in veins  
Order rearranged by my hands through the reins  
Chaos never strange to me but foreign remains  
Cross at the ford of the flow  
Toss rhyme scheme cross the board like I know  
I'm boss of time in a trireme, hands row  
Feet in columns, two tall  
Never too short, stall  
Engines failed, trajectory curl  
Eject towards pearls  
Land I stand on as if I was an earl  
Noble I'm called by them all  
Smoke but not L  
Take not a single one L  
It's double W three, stand with me or get felled like a tree  
All things I touch elevated  
To the top I will escalate it  
Till I hit top of the state  
Where my name will be stated  
A cross of a bat and a man
They call me bad man
They aren't what I am
I'll fire them live like I'm bringing back 'nam

Crush writer's blocks, call me Mario  
I will parry, divide but won't carry y'all  
Make my own beats, spit my own flows, am my own impressario  
Fill my own seats, grit my own teeth, this is the scenario  
Only day is today, hate tomorrow  
Pass me paper
Borrow me a way to make feet move, shuffle  
Extend range on the daily  
Impending uptrend - if I was a tree I'd tower over a sea  
Offhand, see CD to see me
Intend this - a decree - power in thirty three  
Every spend is over in poverty  
Transcend norms and imagination my G  
Comprehend what I mean and read the leaves in the tea  
Top of the game, every thing that I'm saying off the top of the brain  
Popularity gain from the skills that I train, you won't see me praying  
Or my game, will seek fame, I'm not meek, I tame using pain
