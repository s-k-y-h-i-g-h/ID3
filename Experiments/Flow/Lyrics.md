Instrumental Name: MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn - Let Me Watch/ Can I Watch? (Instrumental)

Let me spit  
(What?)  
Let me spit  
(Drop it!)  
Let me spit  
(Spit!)  

Grow hot, throw self out cold spot I'm in, retaliating   
Sin stained so never back in heaven I'm in  
I mean to bring it down, the whole of heaven, I mean
Lean but I ain't taking codeine  
Defined by weight I'm pushing  
A trap, I'm vermin slicing  
Dose odds with even measures ricin  
Opps suck like Dyson
Mind state of ronin, either asleep or roaming  
Honing in on building a Rome on land that I'm purchasing   
With blood, silver, gold and the green  
Deep in the mud nothing's green
I'm brighter than bling  
Strong like a diamond is to a tin  
Stop on point- terminating but I run red, donâ€™t stop  
Except shops from operating    
Ain't ever left but wasn't writing  
This takeover's polarising  
I'm making scenes and causing steel to melt with my steam  
Big cat, pen of mice, mics I'm rapping in  
It's never a wrap, I only talk when I rap and only rap when I sing    

Let me spit  
(What?)  
Let me spit  
(Drop it!)  
Let me spit  
(Spit!)
