I cause losses in formats that's lossless
Cause is ofcourse this
Of my course that like physical forces
Pushes aside competition like "what's this?"
I didn't notice
I don't look at my feet when I walk, 
'bis don't smoke cos I'm out of my mind but sense (cents) talk
Inhale air, exhale dough, always spend but never broke
Farewell spoke to where I got stuck like blood in a stroke
Like a clot in a vein in the brain by episode forced to remain in fear soaked
Year after year, I lost hope but found dope helps to cope when you can't reach the rope
Under this pressure isn't the carbon I'm made of forever or am I still on a slippery slope?

Sitting, drinking, blinking
Getting deep and thinking
About all these things and
Then wind blows my thoughts away like they're sand

for all i know this ain't the end
for all i know you're still my friend
for all i know the shit has gone past hand
and you've gone to put it to an end

I used to think that I was crazy, lazy, hazy
Couldn't see what life had made me
