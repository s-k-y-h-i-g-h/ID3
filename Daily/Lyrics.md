Iterations of complications  
Foundations of neo nations  
Frustrations up in flames like Hatians  
Never on vacation, work so many angles in so many combinations  
Accusation strangles calculations  
Have no decorations  
'Spite high expectations  
Never-ending fluctuations  
That span generations  
Generate new innovations  
None of these are revelations  
Won't see me in publications  
Always in some situations  
Representing populations  
Full of observations  
Many occupations, operations   
Light on obligations
Sane from medications  
Infinite - can't test my patience  
Laying down a new renaissance  
After quitting being a vagrant
