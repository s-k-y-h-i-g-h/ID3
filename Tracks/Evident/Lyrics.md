Instrumental Name: Company Flow - 8 Steps To Perfection Instrumental
     
Score high in measurements  
Religion past tense  
Win cos they pack light, my punches is dense  
True in every sense cept my mind is fenced  
With skulls I still fence  
I get stabbed in romance  
I pay no elements  
Go against me you're mince  
I intended offence  
Santa's for kids  
Which to me all of you is  
Spectators questioning if I meant them in my sentences  
Or if I’m talking shit and they’re witnesses  
In parenthesis, denial that I'll out last while I take the piss
