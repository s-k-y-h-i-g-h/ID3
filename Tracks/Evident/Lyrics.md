Evidence makes judges drop charges  
It ain’t evident if farces make me spit sentiments  
Maybe it’s that all my words making sense  
Or maybe my ego belittle they measurements  
Your religion’s out-dated like past tense  
I’m the type to pick fights with reverends  
And win cos they pack light while mine is dense  
True in every sense cept my mind which like air cept by skull is fenced  
Thank God for that barrier or we’d all be mince  
Not the Christmas type or the Christian type, I intend offence  
Tense reaction like to depression rent  
Spectators questioning if it’s them I meant in my sentences  
Or if I’m talking shit and they’re witnesses  
In parenthesis, denial that I'll out last while I take the piss
