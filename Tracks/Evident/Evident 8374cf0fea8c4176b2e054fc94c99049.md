Evidence makes judges drop sentences
It ain’t evident what makes me spit sentiments

Maybe it’s that all my words making sense

Or maybe my ego belittles heaven’s measurements

Your religion’s out-dated like past tense

I’m the type to pick fights with reverends

And win cos they pack light while mine is dense

True in every sense cept my mind which like air cept by skull is fenced

Thank God for that barrier or we’d all be mince

Not the Christmas type, I intend offence

Tense reaction like to depression rent

Spectators questioning if it’s them I meant in my sentences

Or if I’m talking shit and they’re witnesses

In parenthesis, denial I’ll out last them while I take the piss
