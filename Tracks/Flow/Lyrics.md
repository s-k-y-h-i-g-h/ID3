Instrumental Name: MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn - Let Me Watch/ Can I Watch? (Instrumental)

Grow hot, retaliating to cold spot I found myself in

Found myself sin and never back in heaven I'm in

I mean I'm lean but ain't talking codeine

Defined by the weight I'm pushing

Defy expectations like trap vermin slicing

Mind state of ronin, either asleep or roaming

I'm about to build me a Rome in a land I’m planning on purchasing

This is bigger than green, brighter than them

Stronger like a diamond is to a tin

Stop on point with which I'm terminating but I don’t stop

Except the shops they operating

This takeover’s polarising

Hot, melting polar icing

Blud, you'll hear what I'm saying and reply with a "seen"

I'm making a scene and causing steel to melt with my steam

Big cat in a pen of mice and mics I'm rapping in

It's never a wrap, I only talk when I rap

Too noble to clap

Got a shooter watching my back

Whore counting my stack

Always got more, never come wack

Come at me - get whacked

Say c'est la vie never cos it's me, not life, that's a fact
