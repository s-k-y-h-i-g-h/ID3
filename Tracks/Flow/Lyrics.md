Instrumental Name: MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn - Let Me Watch/ Can I Watch? (Instrumental)
  
Grow hot, found myself in cold spot and I'm retaliating    
Found myself sin and never back in heaven I'm in  
So I mean to bring it down, the whole of heaven, I mean
I mean I'm lean but I ain't taking codeine  
Defined by weight I'm pushing  
Defy expectations like trap vermin slicing  
Mind state of ronin, either I'm asleep or roaming  
About to build a Rome on land I’m planning on purchasing  
With silver, gold and the green  
But this is bigger than green, brighter than bling  
Stronger like a diamond is to a tin  
Stop on point, terminating but I don’t stop  
Except the shops they operating  
Call me the second coming  
But I ain't ever left, just wasn't writing  
This takeover polarising  
Melting polar icing  
You'll hear what I'm saying and reply with a "seen"  
I'm making a scene and causing steel to melt with my steam  
Big cat in a pen of mice, mics rapping in  
It's never a wrap, I only talk when I rap  
Too noble to clap  
Got a shooter watching my back  
Whore counting my stack  
Got more, never come wack  
Come at me - get whacked  
Say c'est la vie never - it's me, not life, that's the fact
