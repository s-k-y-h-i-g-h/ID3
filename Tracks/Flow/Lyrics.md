Instrumental Name: MF DOOM/Viktor Vaughn - Let Me Watch/ Can I Watch? (Instrumental)
  
Grow hot, throw self out cold spot I'm in, retaliating   
I'm sin stained so never back in heaven I'm in  
I mean to bring it down, the whole of heaven, I mean
Refined, lean but ain't taking codeine  
Defined by weight I'm pushing  
A trap, I'm vermin slicing  
Dose odds with even measures ricin  
Opps suck like Dyson, the shame of my son  
Every last one, drown them, red rum till eyes dim some  
Mind state of ronin, either asleep or roaming, freeze! run!  
Honing in on building a Rome on land I plan on purchasing   
With blood, silver, gold, green  
Deep in the mud nothing's green, I'm brighter than bling  
Strong like a diamond is to a tin  
Stop on point- terminating but I run red, donâ€™t stop  
Except shops operating  
Second coming  
Ain't ever left but wasn't writing  
This takeover polarising  
Melts polar icing  
You'll hear what I'm saying and reply with a "seen"  
I'm making a scene and causing steel to melt with my steam  
Big cat in pen of mice, mics I'm rapping in  
It's never a wrap, I only talk when I rap and only rap when I sing    
Too noble to clap but here is the thing    
Got a shooter watching my back for those who escalating    
Whore counting my stack and counting each win  
Got more, I never come wack and always all in  
Come at me - get whacked so keep procrastinating    
Never say c'est la vie cos I am the fact and truth has a sting
