Crush writers blocks like I work demolition
I've got inspiration beyond that of religion
Touch something tough when photons bounce off my skin
Off mic off me comes all of my sin and strikes domes like Tyson

Recoil at the action, did I ever have traction?
Kill wackness like Ricin
Food's only thing that I'm biting, more than one meaning yet only one writing
Double visions and definitions, trouble in all of my missions
I saddle beats like I'm riding and end up streets ahead of the lightening
Beyond storms hoofs trampling, beyond doors perception is frightening
Donâ€™t spar out of fear that I'll wreck ya in full contact fighting
Dealing with me is like huffing ether, opps just chill like being around me either gets them high like cocaine or reefer
Call me a seer, call me to tell me you want me slither my way to a river and drown all the rats who grief give ya
I might just find somewhere without rats and place you there to deliver
