Instrumental Name: Blu & Exile - Dancing In The Rain (Instrumental)

Jamming, waiting for thirty for a couple of tens
hope I dont hit a dirty while jacking thighs through my pants
Im ahead of them all and I intended offense
use my vocals to fence whoever arenâ€™t friends
making a comeback but not to meet ends 

government sponsored cos my psyche is bent like my taste of romance
always in militant stance after terrorist plans
my crew is solid like hash on weekends but on workdays its diamond and spans time from the start to the ends
i bend gender like clay to fit like gloves on my hands
this off the top like jumpers falling from blocks to packed sands
except my dives dont stop or leave me out pants with broken bones among ants
and in pockets leave zero grand but in track record leaves dents
that hit like feet hit floor while doing coke in the grams
