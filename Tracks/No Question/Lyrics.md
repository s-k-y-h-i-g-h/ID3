Instrumental Name: The Foreign Exchange - The Answer (Instrumental)

Crush writer's blocks, call me Mario
I will parry yo', divide and won't carry y'all
Make my own beats, spit my own flows, am my own impressario
Fill my own seats, grit my own bones, this is the scenario
See my own face when I stare at your sorrow
Only day is today, hate tomorrow
Pass me paper, borrow
Me a way to make feet move, shuffle
As if they could step above each other like a snail paced shuttle
I shit on every one of yâ€™all
Irrespective of disagreements or arguments, hoes
Respect it's my game you play and to me y'all sound corny as rows
