# Ideas

- Mumble rap on this track
  
Confusion never losing, stuck to me just like using  
Buck under the weight of multiple G's of multiple keys  
Must be many in the O-Zees like weighing me's  
Elated, I don't need to state much cos I wear words and talk with the touch  
Chem assay my drugs as if to say I donâ€™t know they are they  
Without chromatography, mass spectrometry  
Laid among paragraphs and shuffled among geo photographs  
Of lands I plot to bring under my hands  
Keep low number plans to fill a couple my palms with desert sands  
They run through fingers - hair strands
