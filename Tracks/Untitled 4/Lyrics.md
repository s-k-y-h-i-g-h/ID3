# Ideas

- Mumble rap on this track

Confusion never losing, stuck to me like using

Buck under the weight of grams of powders

Added, must be many in O-Zee, -- K-G's weighing me

Elated, I don't need to state much cos I wear words, talk with touch

Chem assay my drugs as if to say I donâ€™t know they are they

Without graphs- chromatography, mass spectrometry

Laid among paragraphs and shuffled among geographic photographs

Of lands I plot to bring under my dirty hands

Keep low number plans to fill a couple palms with sands

Any more, they'll run through fingers like hair strands
