Confusion never losing, stuck to me like using

Buck under the weight of grams of powders

Added, must be many in O-Zee, kilos down weighing me

Elate thee, state that nowhere lay

Chem assay as if to say I donâ€™t know they are they

Without confirmation of graphs of gas, spectrometry mass, that lay among paragraphs
