Enter to continue, escape to quit  
I enter stage, — escalate real quick  
I am colossus, pain painting thick  
It’s like they say ‘gloss us’ when — brush up I pick  
Brush up real quick, I’m waiting  
Questions? Only statements, never patience  
Now or never, unlicensed to have patients  
Keeping clever, reading papers bout the weather  
Butterlies, tornados, eyes of riders  
Lies in pronunciation of whether  
Never pronounce --, no matter situation or weather  
It’s critical, hear me, I say this, y’all  
This period define the rest of ‘em and in peace will rest none them all    
True for all before but true, no mo’  
Rest of yo, to me, move in slow-mo  
Must be bad time cos it ain’t flying  
Only things airbourne are me, CO-V one-three, O2, N, and E-T-C  
T-A of my ascent in neg T lay  
Reporting live, my ends ain’t frayed  
My E not spent, my will just will not end  
Feel for whoever reads my will if I get hell or heaven sent  
It goes back from fo’  
Paddle back the flow  
Rhythm saddle from the back and fo'  
Ass I paddle back and fo'
Truth I vessel forward row and tow  
Every one of them I’m providing sanctuary fo’  
Not too many, many sight have no and deaf as feet shuffle 
Arms pebbles throw  
But unaware of what they lack, where their stones fall  
Even if fate certain that they’ll fall  
Those who my assistance will take no  
I leave to ferry to the floor and roll  
Fires only fight when asked to, ball  
Only bounce when elastic it’s ma-ter-ial  
And therefor not all balls bounce but they all roll
