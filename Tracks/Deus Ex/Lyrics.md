Tell like it is, sell bits of mic to fund biz, lose voice in the process
Utilise forces, on opps cast curses, first to thirst for the sources
Also reverse this, worst is landing in hearses, terse is the end unless I learn enough courses
To side-step with life divorces, is this my fate or will I lose in this versus?
At this rate you could mistake procreation for hate, that's why I won't mate
Unless I play chess with a date, then them undress hour late, depending on their out of ten rate
But wonâ€™t with them replicate to save someone their fate and for someone else the work to cremate
Morbid maybe perspective lately but hope I hold more than faintly
