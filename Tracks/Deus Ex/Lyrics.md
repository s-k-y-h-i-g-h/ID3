Tell like it is  
Sell bits of mic to fund biz  
Lose voice in the process  
Utilise forces  
On opps cast curses  
First to thirst for the sources  
Also reverse this  
Worst is landing in hearses  
Terse is the end unless I learn enough courses  
To side-step with life divorces  
Is this my fate or will I lose in this versus?  
At this rate you could mistake procreation for hate  
That's why I won't mate  
Unless I play chess with a date  
Then them undress hour late  
Depending on their out of ten rate  
But wonâ€™t with them replicate  
To save someone their fate  
And for someone else the work to cremate  
Morbid maybe perspective lately  
But hope I hold more than faintly
