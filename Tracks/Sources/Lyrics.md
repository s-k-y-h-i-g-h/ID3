Bet you never turned copy left  
To park where creativity commonly kept  
A copy I left at the head of this text  
After typing the rest for the blind, dumb and deaf  
Your rights if you copy and step  
How I walk dictate that, like me, what you beat and you talk  
You leave open to re-inter it  
To whoever picks up the pace of your drop  
Whether you found this with cat, grep or sed  
And changed it with Vi, 'macs or Ed  
To be ahead of a curve means to surpass it’s X, Y or Z  
Curves vary in degrees in their bend in mid-step  
And being ahead might end up behind when extended  
Goes to reason you should know the curve I’m stepping and not to run to winter inn   
Soon as you see rise late sun past six in AM  
Before you move with my beats and flow to a gram
