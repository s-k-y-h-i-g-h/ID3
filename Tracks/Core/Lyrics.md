I don't even think no more  
I just listen and keep track of the score  
At the back of the store  
Pack a rock and another four  
Drop a verse and another score  
Hit a twenty and then recyc some more  
My drug use hard to the core  
Blend in with the decor  
While fending off desire to go on a tour  
I ain’t like you show keys stuck on four by fours  
Live big, spit big, bigger than you and every one yours  
Rhymes that to my ears are tortures  
I ain’t just trapped by the allures  
I make my fortune legal and ill, more is more  
Come real, with every bar I emplore  
That y’all rebar you shit so I don’t crush when I explore  
Ain’t even looking to argue no more  
It’s a fight to the death with every one of you whores
